Inspired by [WesBos' uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

### Editor + Terminal
* I use **Visual Studio Code** as an editor, to which I switched to last year (coming from Atom).
* I use [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) as font.
* I use [An old hope with italics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codepunkt.vscode-oldhope-italics) as syntax-theme.
* I use Mac's standard Terminal App with zsh+ohmyzsh.
* I use git almost entirely in the Terminal (if I'm not I use VSCode's built-in solution).

### Desktop Apps
* I design almost everything using Invision Studio.
* I have a Spotify subscription for my music.
* I use Apple's Reminders as a ToDo list

### Hardware
* I use a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro (mid 2015)
* I use a Logitech MX Master for a mouse
