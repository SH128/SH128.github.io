Inspired by [WesBos' uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

As a web developer you use a lot of different tools. There are a lot of options out there and everyone has their own set of tools, below I've listed some of the tools in my setup.

### Devices
ðŸ’» **15" MacBook Pro Retina (mid 2015)**, been using it everyday since I bought it and it still never fails me.

ðŸ“±**iPhone X**, bought it in 2017, still a good phone, might need a new battery though.

ðŸŽ§ **AirPods** (commuting and calls), **Beats Solo 3** in silver/white (for work)

### Desktop Apps
**Spark mail**, my e-mail client

**Slack**, **Discord**, **Telegram**/**iMesssage**, communication channels

**Spotify**, don't follow me, I have got awful taste in music.

**Terminal**, standard macOS Terminal with zsh-shell and ohmyzsh.

**Sequel Pro**, to manage MySQL-Databases.

### Creative

**InVision Studio**/**Adobe XD**

**Pixelmator**

### Editor

**Visual Studio Code**, my main editor, to which I switched to last year (coming from Atom). I use [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) as font with [An old hope with italics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codepunkt.vscode-oldhope-italics) as syntax-theme.

**Nova**, testing it out (literally).

### Solutions

**Stripe**

**Netlify**
