Well, look at that, I finally managed to launch my own blog. This is my playground where I can share my knowledge, mostly but not limited to programming, designing and minimalism, and a place where I can write down things I learnt from side-projects.

I don't have a comment section (because they generally suck), I will however crosspost some articles (mostly those imparting wisdom) to [DEV](https://dev.to), where there's a comment section underneath an article.
