Oh god, what's that title here? Couldn't you find an even more clichéd phrase for a developer, like yourself, to introduce the launch of your website?

<br />
Well, I've finally launched my own blog again. Wait, *again*? Yes, again! I used to blog while I've been in school, don't know exactly why stopped, but I miss it. You know? Sharing knowledge still works best with the written word, although I do enjoy a bit of live streaming myself as well.

<br />
As this is also my website, or portfolio, as the *cool kids* call it nowadays, I'll blog about all kinds of things that are interesting to me. Primarily I'll be imparting my knowledge, this might result in longer articles or shorter “Today I learnt“ (TIL) kind of things. Maybe I'll post learnings from my side projects, or bits and pieces from my life (if I'm not sharing them on social media, which is more likely, tbh).

<br />
Cheerio,

Stephanie
